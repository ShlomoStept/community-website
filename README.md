Paper Abstract (Paraphrased): With language models demonstrating impressive performance on earlier quantitative reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, such as MMLU [6] and MATH [7], these benchmarks have become saturated and obsolete. Despite this, superhuman performance on these tasks remains unattained. Our paper presents DAB, a new benchmark designed to evaluate language models on quantitative reasoning, text comprehension, and expert domain reasoning in a more challenging manner than previous benchmarks. DAB encompasses questions requiring knowledge in various fields, including mathematics, physics, machine learning, biology, chemistry, and law.

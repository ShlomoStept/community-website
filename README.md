## About Us
We are a group of researchers passionate about exploring the capabilities and potential of large language models and multimodal models. Our current focus lies in developing and examining various dataset projects to understand the depth and performance of these models in diverse domains (and say something along the line of developing the data of underexplored yet important tasks)

### DAAB: DuckAI Advanced Academic Benchmark (Coming soon)
Tentative Paper Abstract: Language models (LMs) have shown increasingly good performance on most prior quantitative reasoning and knowledge benchmarks, such as MMLU (Hendrycks et. al., 2020) and MATH This has rendered many of these benchmarks saturated and effectively obsolete, as LMs can now solve them easily, even though superhuman performance on these tasks has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, we introduce DAB, a new benchmark for evaluating LMs not only on quantitative reasoning, but also on text comprehension and expert domain reasoning, designed to be much more challenging than prior benchmarks. DAB contains questions requiring knowledge of mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and law.
